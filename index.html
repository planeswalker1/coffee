    <h3 class="note__heading">A Note on Roasting</h3>
    <p class="note__description">
        Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of raw coffee beans into roasted coffee products. This process
        is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee beans to change in taste. Many coffee
        roasters determine the level of roast by eye, assessing the color of the beans to determine the desired roast-level.

                Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta accounts for the remaining
                30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing cluster of states led by Rio where
                arabica is produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state
                of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.

                Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor characteristics of Pacific coffees, but at its
                worst bland and uninspiring. The two well known species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta. Probably
                the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia is S.795.
